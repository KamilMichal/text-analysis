Project for Development of Information Systems 2023 - Text Analysis

Our team:

Alonso - supervision of coding

Patrik - work management

Kamil - documentation, communication

Our goal is to develop two applications. First one will be used as a tool in a search for signs of aphasia in texts based on statistics of the closest connections between words. The system will analyze given input file and produce statistics of every word connection in it. Statistics will be stored in database. On the basis of this statistics system will produce graphs. Second system will prepare statistics of punctuations marks in texts. The system will analyze given input file for number of punctuation mark and the lengths (measured in the number of words) between any two punctuation marks: longest, shortest and average for given input. On the basis of this statistics system can produce graphs.
